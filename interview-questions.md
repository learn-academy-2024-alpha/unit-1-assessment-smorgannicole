# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: I'm not familiar with the exact differences between git and Github, but I do know that Github is a version control software that is designed to track changes made when coding. Git on the other hand is part of the graphical user intrface (GUI ðŸ˜‰) that allows us to interact with github through various commands like git clone.

Researched answer: Git is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in source code. It keeps a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code. Github is a hosting service for Git repositories and has some additional features. GitHub allows developers to share their repositories, access other developersâ€™ repositories, and store remote copies of repositories. Git is like a single computer and GitHub is like a network of multiple interconnected computers, all with the same end goal.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index represents a particular position in that array denoted by a number from 0 to however many values the array has. Each value in the array can be accessed using the index. The value of the array are the array components themselves, separated by a comma.

Researched answer: An array is an ordered list of elements or values. The array is ordered by index which indicates the position of the element within the array starting from 0. 

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: 
Similarities:
-both are data types
-can store both into variables
-arrays and strings can both be iterated through
-they both share properties and methods like .length and .slice() to name a couple

Differences:
-certain methods and properties they don't share like .reverse()
-can't use higher order functions on strings
-arrays can hold different values/data types
-strings are a primitive data type and arrays are a different data type that I can't remember the name of :)
-strings are immutable and arrays are not

Researched answer:
Similarities:
-both are collections of elements that are stored sequentially in memory
-elements can be accessed using index values
-both support various operations like concatenation, slicing, iteration, and searching
-both are passable

Differences:
-type of data array can hold vs string
-strings are usually can't be changed after creation while arrays are usually mutable
-strings are representated by quotes (" ") or apostrophes (' ') while arrays are usually defined by square brackets ([])

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Your answer: 
I have this in my notes from Codeup :) 
1) Abstraction which is abstracting the complexity or simplifying
2) Encapsulation which is when all related functions are organized under one class. This helps avoid long naming conventions too
3) Inheritance which uses "extends" keyword to get access to the properties of another object all in the interest of not repeating oneself 
4) Polymorphism which is anything being changed when the "inheritance" is happening

Researched answer: Honestly what I'm finding on the internet about OOP loosely makes sense to me so I am finding it a little difficult to not just copy and paste my findings

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: A collection of properties which are just key-value pairs. In order to access the value, you have to reference the key using dot notation. The "this" key word is really neat because it allows you to reference the object while it's still being made. A lot of API data is objects.

2. Classes: Denoted by a capital first letter, classes are reusable and help with organization. They're essential for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. Classes are the "encapsulation" part of OOP.

3. React: React is a javascript library which is just an open-source frameweork! It's efficient on the user-interaction side because if a change is made, the DOM only has to reload that component rather than the whole webpage (I think). Overall these 3 terms help with organizing code and allowing the developer to avoid repition.
